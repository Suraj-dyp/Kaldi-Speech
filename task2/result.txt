a)
    phones.txt contains various suffixes meaning for which is explained below:
    _B: beginning of a word
    _I: word-internal
    _E: word-ending
    _S: singleton word i.e. a phone with only one word

b)
    There are lot of symbols at end of file phones.txt which starts #.
    These phone symbols are called disambiguation symbols and we will explain those below:
    
    1) #1, #2, #3, and so on - These are used when a phoneme sequence is a prefix of 
       another phoneme sequence in the lexicon. We add these symbols to such that L o G 
       is determinizable

    2) #0 - These are backoff arcs symbols in the language model G to ensure that G is 
       determinizable after removing epsilons

    3) #-1 - These are put in place of epsilons that appear on the left of context FST C
       before we start outputting symbols for words with an empty phonetic representation 
       (e.g. when the beginning and end of sentence symbols <s> and </s>).
