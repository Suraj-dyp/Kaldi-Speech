#Steps to perform Task 5 :  Rescoring with a larger LM

Results :

5 (a): WER : 43.88
   Time : real(7m57.104s), user(11m14.331s), system(0m26.146s)
  (b): WER : 46.5
   Time : real(0m8.201s), user(0m18.131s), system(0m0.957s)
Approach (b) i.e. using lmrescore.sh is faster that approach (a) where we have to explicitly reconstruct HCLG graph and then calculate the WER.
The second approach is faster by 26.103seconds.

Assumption : Task 1 to Task3 have already been executed.

Task 5 (a)
1. set stage=5 in run.sh
2. Line 91 replace exp/*/decode* with exp/tri1/decode*
3. run the script : ./run.sh
or if you want to see how much time it took, then
run the following command  : time ./run.sh

Task 5 (b)
1. create a directory data/lang5   : mkdir data/lang5
2. copy contents of data/lang to data/lang5 : cp -r data/lang data/lang5/
3. copy task5/G.fst to data/lang5/ : cp task5/G.fst data/lang5/
4. create direcotory :  mkdir exp/tri5/decode_test
time steps/lmrescore.sh data/lang data/lang5 data/test exp/tri1/decode_test/ exp/tri5/decode_test

Check WER in the following direcotry:
cat exp/tri5/decode_test/wer_13
